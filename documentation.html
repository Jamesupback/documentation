                    solar system's mass. It sheds most of the heat and light that makes life possible on Earth and

                    elsewhere. Planets orbit the sun in oval-shaped paths called ellipses, with the sun slightly

                    of each ellipse.

                    system — it is only a little larger than Earth's moon. Mercury zips around the sun in only 88 days
                    and because it is so close to our star (about two-fifths the distance between Earth and the sun).

                    Mercury experiences dramatic changes in its day and night temperatures. Mercury temperatures can
                    reach a scorching 840 F (450 C) in the day, which is hot enough to melt lead. Meanwhile, on the
                    night side, temperatures drop to minus 290 F (minus 180 C). </p>

                    pressure at the surface would crush and kill you. And oddly, Venus spins slowly from east to west,
                    the opposite direction of most of the other planets.

                    Venus is sometimes referred to as Earth's twin as they are similar in size and radar images beneath
                    its atmosphere reveal numerous mountains and volcanoes. But beyond that, the planets could not be
                    more different.

                    The Greeks believed Venus was two different objects — one in the morning sky and another in the
                    evening. Because it is often brighter than any other object in the sky, Venus has generated many UFO

                    in iron oxide dust that gives the planet its signature red hue. Mars shares similarities with Earth:
                    It is rocky, has mountains, valleys and canyons, and storm systems ranging from localized
                    tornado-like dust devils to planet-engulfing dust storms.

                    Substantial scientific evidence suggests that Mars at one point billions of years ago was a much
                    warmer, wetter world, rivers and maybe even oceans existed. Although Mars' atmosphere is too thin
                    for liquid water to exist on the surface for any length of time, remnants of that wetter Mars still
                    exist today. Sheets of water ice the size of California lie beneath Mars' surface, and at both poles
                    are ice caps made in part of frozen water. </p>

                <p class="description">When polymath Galileo Galilei first studied Saturn in the early 1600s, he thought
                    it was an object with three parts: a planet and two large moons on either side. Not knowing he was
                    seeing a planet with rings, the stumped astronomer entered a small drawing — a symbol with one large
                    circle and two smaller ones — in his notebook, as a noun in a sentence describing his discovery.
                    More than 40 years later, Christiaan Huygens proposed that they were rings.

                    The rings are made of ice and rock and scientists are not yet sure how they formed. The gaseous
                    planet is mostly hydrogen and helium and has numerous moons.</p>

                <p class="description">Astronomers believe an object twice the size of Earth collided with Uranus
                    roughly 4 billion years ago, causing Uranus to tilt. That tilt causes extreme seasons that last
                    20-plus years, and the sun beats down on one pole or the other for 84 Earth-years at a time.

                    The collision is also thought to have knocked rock and ice into Uranus' orbit. These later became
                    some of the planet's 27 moons. Methane in Uranus' atmosphere gives the planet its blue-green tint.
                    It also has 13 sets of faint rings.

                    Uranus holds the record for the coldest temperature ever measured in the solar system — minus 371.56
                    degrees F (minus 224.2 degrees C). The average temperature of Uranus is minus 320 degrees Fahrenheit
                    (-195 degrees Celsius).</p>

                    strong winds. The planet is more than 30 times as far from the sun as Earth.

                    Neptune was the first planet predicted to exist by using math, rather than being visually detected.
                    Irregularities in the orbit of Uranus led French astronomer Alexis Bouvard to suggest some other
                    planet might be exerting a gravitational tug. German astronomer Johann Galle used calculations to
                    help find Neptune in a telescope. Neptune is about 17 times as massive as Earth and has a rocky core
